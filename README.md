# This was the main project for our Software Design class. This project was to design a criminal database that officers could log into to fill out reports on crime and include any involved Evidence, Witnesses, Victims, and Suspects. It went through the entire design process, starting with gathering specific requirements from our professor, who acted as our client throughout the entire project, and ended with fairly comprehensive bug testing. We also built a prototype app for this project using Proto.io and although it didn't use our code to run, it was built with the full vision of our project in mind, and we did go through a week of user testing with family and friends to better refine the functionality. 

This being a major learning experience for the entire team, there are some files in this repository that never ended up being used as we thought we could accomplish stuff one way, only to figure out later on it wasn't needed at all. I tried my best to delete most of these files, but some of them do remain and I don't want to accidentally delete something that would entirely ruin the project. I tried my best to comment on all the code that we ARE using, so it's easier to see what is actually working in the long run.
